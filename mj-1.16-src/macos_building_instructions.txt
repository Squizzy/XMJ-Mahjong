Install Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) : 

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

install gtk2:
    brew install gtk+

install pkg-config
    brew install pkg-config

download the source of 1.15
decompress the tar.gz by double clicking in finder
in terminal, go to the folder that was created by the decompression

run make
    make

run make install
    make install

make a link from the install folder to /Applications, where most applications are run from
    ln -s /usr/local/bin/xmj /Applications/XMJ


Some refining is still needed:
1) XMJ will appear under Applications in Finder, but not in Lanchpad - it might need to be packaged in a certain way to appear correctly there - I might figure it out later

    I've tried to change the DESTDIR and BINDIR in both Makefile to "/Applications" and "". This will installs the 3 files there, but when I start a game it throws an error "server failed to start", which is not the case if I use the ln from the /usr/local/bin - any idea why? Is the application trying to find a specific something in /usr/local/bin?

    The other drawback of make to /Applications of course is that the mj-server and the mj-player appear in there, too, when they should be invisible.

2) The application won't show the correct icon, just a simple icon terminal-like with "exec" in it. It might need to be packaged into a XMJ.app, but I don't know the way to do this yet, if I get to it, I will let you know.

3) For some reason the tiles played by others appear with a yellow background,
